"""Fleet usage ledger — append-only token accounting for every fleet lane.

This is the single place all forward token usage is recorded for lanes that
otherwise write nothing to disk (local Ollama/Gemma, OpenRouter, HF, etc.).
token_tracker.py reads the resulting JSONL as additional providers.

Design rules:
- Best-effort and FAIL-SAFE: logging must NEVER raise into an inference path.
- Append-only JSONL, one record per model call. No mutation of past rows.
- Plain integer token counts only; never write prompt/response text or secrets.
