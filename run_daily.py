"""NouGenTracker daily fleet job.

RECONSTRUCTED 2026-09-07. The original wrapper lived only on WhoArt's disk,
was never tracked by git (`git log --all -- '*run_daily*'` is empty), and
disappeared between two runs on 2026-09-06. This rebuild follows the behaviour
documented in the scheduled-task spec; it is committed so the job cannot
vanish again.

Two jobs:

  1. Backfill every CLOSED day this machine still owes, oldest first, via
     token_tracker.py --publish (which exports *and* commits).
  2. Build the fleet readout (per-machine tokens + API-equivalent shadow cost,
     plus a week-to-date burn-down against the Saturday reset) and write it to
     readouts/<today>.txt.

Two invariants, deliberate:

  * NEVER today. An open day reports floors, not totals (partial: true).
    A floor inside a summed series is worse than a hole.
  * NEVER regenerate a day that already published. Re-running an aged day
    reads a partially pruned corpus and silently undercounts. Published state
    is decided with `git ls-files`, not a directory listing -- a daily can sit
    on disk untracked and look published.
